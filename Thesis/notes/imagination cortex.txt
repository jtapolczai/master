thinking words -> signal from the frontal cortex to the auditory cortex which shuts the auditory cortex down ("don't listen to this, it's only you talking")

=> two-layer experience:
   1) the "processed" experience
   2) the sensory experience

actual sensation:
   sensory experience -> processed experience

   (message 2 - the meaning)

imagination:
   processed experience -> inhibited sensory experience
   (message 1 - the meaning)
   (no reality)
