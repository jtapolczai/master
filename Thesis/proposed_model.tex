\title{{\huge An Evolutionary, Affective Model of Cognition}}

\begin{abstract}
Modern AI generally falls into two categories, separated by the employed level of abstraction: low-level modelling on one hand, which employs neural networks to simulate individual neurons, and the symbolic or logic-based approach, which first posits an ideal, rational intelligence and then tries to capture it search algorithms and calculi. In this thesis, I describe a model of human cognition based on an evolutionary approach. The basis of this endeavour is the idea that one must understand the developmental history of a complex system if one wished to understand how it works. Starting with a white-box model of computation, we construct a semi-organized mesh of neural components, and then describe plausible models of emotion and reasoning, without invoking rule-based or provably correct methods. Lastly, we implement a number of agents based on these models and employ them in a competitive, moderately complex scenario as a proof of concept.
