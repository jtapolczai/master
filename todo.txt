"play fast and loose with consistency" in "selected subsystems"

* describe attack semantics
* restructure "selected subsystems" into separate chapters
* make chapter: global architecture
* "counterfactual perception"... elegant solution to the problem of consciousness



* wumpus: if line of sight, approaches agent depending on temperature and distance
    -> colder => agent can get closer without being attacked
    -> colder => wumpus is weaker (but agent fatigues more)

	* agent travel -> take into account fatigue and danger
	
	* agent engages with other agents
	
	* agent sees environment
	
	* agent drops/picks up items
	
	* agents stays in place -> traverses loop -> fatigue restore (per edge direction function)
	
	* fights wumpus, outcome depends on wumpus/agent strength and health
	  (fatigue: attack power, health: defense)

 * best fatigue regen in temperate temp, slower in freezing/hot
 
 * agent: health regen each turn
 * agent: health regen with eating plants
 
 * plants regen after N turns
 
 * agents can attack/be friendly with each other
 * attack effectiveness depends on fatigue
 * agents can give gold gifts to each other => increase friendliness
 * small gold gifts => spite?
   ** large gold gifts => impressed?
   ** not handcrafted; depends on agent's affective state
 

 * killed wumpus drops meat => health regen
 * meat and fruits can be gathered into inventories and gifted to other
   agents, like gold
   
 * gold => one-time gathering
 * plants => repeated gathering
 * meat => hunting
 
 *agents can attack/defend together against wumpuses
 
 *wumpuses are territorial herbivores; move on their own. defend plants and kill agents.
