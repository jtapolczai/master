The affectrive subsystem is only a tiny part of the cognitive structure. In particular, it's input component [Pr] is *extremely* complex and subsumes such difficult tasks as sight, hearing, and spatial reasoning. The model is also a simplification of the cognitive process and is therefore, to some significant degree, false. In particular, it lumps together sensory attention with raw processing and sequentializes the relationship of the two with the emotional system, whereas in reality, the relationship is bidirectional. Intuitively, we can think of cases, say, extreme distress which causes an individual to completely ignore certain sights or sounds[1]. Nonetheless, due to reduced algorithmic and computations complexity, I judge this trade-off to be worth it.

[1] It of course is an open question to *what degree* the individual ignores input. Lack of awareness at the conscious level still admits subconscious emotional processing. Arguments containing the word "intuitively" are to be regarded with caution, as we can not trust the immediacy of our subjective experience.
