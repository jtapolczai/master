\begin{abstract}
Modern AI is generally divided into two schools of thought, separated by the used level of abstraction. We have, on one hand, the biologically inspired, low-level modelling which uses neural networks to imitate the workings of brains. On the other, we have a logic-oriented, high-level approach that tries design and implement ideal ways of thinking. In recent decades, the latter approach has triumphed and has displaced computational model based on neural networks. In this practically oriented thesis, I shall make the case that this was perhaps too hasty, and that, despite their many applications, purely logic- and planning-based algorithms are insufficient to model authentic intelligence. This work is composed of two parts; the first is an empirical argument for placing models of AI on evolutionary foundations, under the assumption that we can best understand the workings of a complex artefact like the animal brain by tracing its history; the second is a description of an implementation of a kind of affective agent based on these principles, serving as a proof-of-concept that one can create simple, animal-like intelligence with them.
