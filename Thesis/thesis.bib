abstract ={Cnidaria have traditionally been viewed as the most basal animals with complex, organ-like multicellular structures dedicated to sensory perception. However, sponges also have a surprising range of the genes required for sensory and neural functions in Bilateria. Here, we: (1) discuss “sense organ” regulatory genes, including; sine oculis, Brain 3, and eyes absent, that are expressed in cnidarian sense organs; (2) assess the sensory features of the planula, polyp, and medusa life-history stages of Cnidaria; and (3) discuss physiological and molecular data that suggest sensory and “neural” processes in sponges. We then develop arguments explaining the shared aspects of developmental regulation across sense organs and between sense organs and other structures. We focus on explanations involving divergent evolution from a common ancestral condition. In Bilateria, distinct sense-organ types share components of developmental-gene regulation. These regulators are also present in basal metazoans, suggesting evolution of multiple bilaterian organs from fewer antecedent sensory structures in a metazoan ancestor. More broadly, we hypothesize that developmental genetic similarities between sense organs and appendages may reflect descent from closely associated structures, or a composite organ, in the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria, and we argue that such similarities between bilaterian sense organs and kidneys may derive from a multifunctional aggregations of choanocyte-like cells in a metazoan ancestor. We hope these speculative arguments presented here will stimulate further discussion of these and related questions.},

	abstract = {What happens to our conception of mind and rational agency when we take seriously future-directed intentions and plans and their roles as inputs into further practical reasoning? The author's initial efforts in responding to this question resulted in a series of papers that he wrote during the early 1980s. In this book, Bratman develops further some of the main themes of these essays and also explores a variety of related ideas and issues. He develops a planning theory of intention. Intentions are treated as elements of partial plans of action. These plans play basic roles in practical reasoning, roles that support the organization of our activities over time and socially. Bratman explores the impact of this approach on a wide range of issues, including the relation between intention and intentional action, and the distinction between intended and expected effects of what one intends.},

doi = {10.1073/pnas.1106363108}, 
abstract ={Voltage-dependent sodium channels are believed to have evolved from calcium channels at the origin of the nervous system. A search of the genome of a single-celled choanoflagellate (the sister group of animals) identified a gene that is homologous to animal sodium channels and has a putative ion selectivity filter intermediate between calcium and sodium channels. Searches of a wide variety of animal genomes, including representatives of each basal lineage, revealed that similar homologs were retained in most lineages. One of these, the Placozoa, does not possess a nervous system. We cloned and sequenced the full choanoflagellate channel and parts of two placozoan channels from mRNA, showing that they are expressed. Phylogenetic analysis clusters the genes for these channels with other known sodium channels. From this phylogeny we infer ancestral states of the ion selectivity filter and show that this state has been retained in the choanoflagellate and placozoan channels. We also identify key gene duplications and losses and show convergent amino acid replacements at important points along the animal lineage.},

volume = {202}, 
number = {9}, 
pages = {1139-1150}, 
year = {1999}, 
abstract ={All-or-none propagated electrical impulses were recorded from the hexactinellid sponge Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni using suction electrodes attached to lumps of aggregated sponge tissue grafted onto the surface of pieces of the same sponge. Impulses were normally evoked by means of externally applied electrical shocks. Recorded externally using an a.c.-coupled amplifier, the electrical event was triphasic and lasted approximately 30 s; integration gave a diphasic waveform. A further integration to give the form of the membrane action potential produced a monophasic signal. Impulses propagated at 0.27+/−0.1 cm s-1 with an absolute refractory period of 29 s and a relative refractory period of approximately 150 s. Concurrent thermistor flow meter recordings confirmed that water flow through the sponge was arrested following the passage of an impulse, presumably as result of the cessation of beating of the flagella in the flagellated chambers. Tactile stimuli also evoked impulses, as did addition of particulate material to the incoming water stream. Impulses continued to propagate through the sponge during arrests, indicating that the conduction and effector systems were independent. Sponges lack nerves, and a variety of evidence indicates that the conducting tissues are the syncytial trabecular reticulum and pinacoderm layers. Na+-deficient solutions had little effect on the action potential, but propagation was blocked by 10 mmol l-1 Co2+, 1 mmol l-1 Mn2+ or 24 micromol l-1 nimodipine. Tetraethylammonium ions at 1–5 mmol l-1 also blocked propagation without prolonging the action potential. Impulse conduction in the sponge is discussed in relation to excitability and conduction in the protozoa and in plants and to non-nervous conduction in more advanced animals.},
