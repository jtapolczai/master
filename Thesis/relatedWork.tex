Answer-set programming was created by Gelfond and Lifschitz \cite{asp1}. Soon after them, Subrahmanian made the connection between ASP and planning \cite{Subrahmanian95relatingstable}. Together with Either and others, he later developed the \acthex\ language which allowed provided a framework for decision making in logic programming via external input and output atoms \cite{heterogeneous1, heterogeneous2, heterogeneous3}.
